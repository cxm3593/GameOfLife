					<p>An embeded youtube video is on the index page, down at the bottom.</p>
					<p>The JavaScript that I implemented is on the game page. It was written from scratch followed online guides. 
						Some modification was made to it to make it run better.
					</p>
					<p>
						The section that I did well was the implementation and adaption of the Game of Life on website. 
						I had no experience with programming in JavaScript before. And practiced a lot starting with simpler programs in JavaScript.
						The original plan was to code a game in C++, but it does not support cross platform usage. Then I changed my plan to Java, 
						however, that could not be shown on website as well. So I eventually decide to spend more time learning about JavaScript, and 
						html canvas to make it possible.
					</p>

					<p>
						The CSS rollover effect is on the logo in navigation bar. Hover on it and it will change opacity.
					</p>

					<p>
						The overall color scheme could be more polished. I picked color conservatively so that the appearance will not look too bizarre at 
						least. And there could more decoration on nevigation bar to make it look better. Also, it would be better if I could make the gallery 
						to use my JavaScript to present the patterns. I tried but eventually stuck with some issues and did not make it.
