						In this page, I will present how to implement the random generated game of life displayed on the game page. 
						The game is based on Javascript to be presented on a website.
					</p>
					<p>
						This section followed the guide of <a href="http://disruptive-communications.com/conwaylifejavascript/">LC's How I built Conwayâ€™s Game of Life in JavaScript</a>
					</p>

					<h3>Array and Grid</h3>
					<p>
						The game is based on a 2d array working as the grid storing positions. 
						There multiple ways to implement a 2d array in JavaScript. 
						Though it is not as easy as making a 2d array in other programming languages. 
						The Implementation is not difficult. 
						To implement 2d array, first build an array and iterate through it. 
						For every array cells, populate it with a new empty array.
					</p>
					<pre>
var grid = Array(size);
for (var i=0; i&lt;size; i++){
	grid[i] = new Array(size);
}
					</pre>
					<p>
						For this game, wrap it up with a function makeGrid(size) with it.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="content_section">
					<h3>Populate and Update Grid</h3>
					<p>
						To populate the grid, there multiples ways to do so. Here I simply iterate through this 2d array. 
						And for each position, call Math.rand() to get a random number. 
						That number will be between 0 and 1. 
						But that will cause too many cells are spawn in the first generation. So, I introduced a rate variable to control it.
						The random number will be multiplied by the rate. Then round the result with Math.round(). 
						If the result is the rate, then put a live cell in this position. (set this indexed position into 1)
					</p>
					<pre>
						
function populateGrid(grid){ // populate the grid randomly.
	var rate = 7
	for(var i=100; i&lt;grid_size-100; i++){
		for(var j=100;j&lt;grid_size-100;j++){
			var randNumber = Math.round(Math.random() * rate); 
			if(randNumber == rate){
				grid[i][j] = 1;
			}else{
				grid[i][j] = 0;
			}
			
		}
	}
}
						
					</pre>

					<p>
						Update is also simple.
						The update function loop through this 2d array and check the surroundings of indexes by adding the values around it.
						And then apply rules to it.
					</p>
					<pre>
function updateGrid(){
	for(i=1;i&lt;grid_size-1;i++){
		for(j=1;j&lt;grid_size-1;j++){
			var cell_count = 0;
			cell_count += grid[i-1][j-1];
			cell_count += grid[i-1][j];
			cell_count += grid[i-1][j+1];
			cell_count += grid[i][j-1];
			cell_count += grid[i][j+1];
			cell_count += grid[i+1][j-1];
			cell_count += grid[i+1][j];
			cell_count += grid[i+1][j+1];

			if(grid[i][j]==0){
				if(cell_count==3){
					mirrorGrid[i][j] = 1;
				}else{
					mirrorGrid[i][j] = 0;
				}
			}else if(grid[i][j]==1){
				if(cell_count==2 || cell_count==3){
					mirrorGrid[i][j]=1;
				}else{
					mirrorGrid[i][j]=0;
				}
			}
		}
	}

	var temp = grid;
	grid = mirrorGrid;
	mirrorGrid = temp;
}
					</pre>
					<p>
						The mirrorGrid is a temporary place holder which holds new generated grid to be presented. In the end of the function, 
						apply that information to the original grid.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="content_section">
					<h3>Drawing Grid</h3>
					<p>
						Finally, we need to draw the grid into the website. 
						First, we put a canvas in html code which will be the place to draw on.
						Then use Javascript to get that canvas from documentation. 
						Use Canvas.clearRect() function to clear out the old grid to avoid blending different grids together.
						The interate through the updated grid again, while updating the canvas using canvas.fillRect() function to draw small rectangles on it.
					</p>
					<pre>
function drawGrid() { // draw the grid on canvas on website
	var ctx = canv.getContext(&quot;2d&quot;);
	ctx.clearRect(0, 0, 400, 400);
	for(var i=0; i&lt;grid_size;i++){
		for(var j=0;j&lt;grid_size;j++){
			if(grid[i][j] == 1){
				ctx.fillStyle = &quot;#000000&quot;;
				ctx.fillRect(i, j, 1, 1);
			}
		}
	}
}
					</pre>
				</div>

				<div class="content_section">
					<h3>
						Animation Loop
					</h3>
					<p>
						To make the website to render animation smoothly. Try to use requestAnimationFrame() function:
					</p>
					<pre>
function loop(){
	drawGrid();
	updateGrid();
	requestAnimationFrame(loop);
}
					</pre>
