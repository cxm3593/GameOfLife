					<h2>Overview of Game of Life</h2>
					<p>
						Conway's Game of Life is a well known zero player game. Which means that the process of this game do not have
						any user input involved. The program automatically generates output from the initial state. The game was first
						invented in 1970s by a British mathematican, John Conway. Conway developed this great simulation which could 
						generate complex outputs with given simple game rules.

					<p>
						The components of this game are simple. It runs on a 2d grid which contains a certain amount of positions that can
						hold a cell. A cell can be in a state of either "dead" or "alive": a dead cell will appear as a blank space while any
						alive cell will appear as a occupied space (visible).
					</p>
	
					<p>
						Rules of this game are simple as well:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>If any dead cell has exactly three living neighbors, it will be alive in next generation.</li>
							<li>If any alive cell has less than two living neighbors, it will die in next generation because of underpopulation</li>
							<li>If any alive cell has more than three living neighbors, it will die in next generation because of overpopulation</li>
							<li>If any alive cell has two or three living neighbors, it will continue to live in next generation.</li>
						</ul>
